AI-Battle
=========

A Python implementation of AI programming battles.


The server.py file runs on the host computer.
Two players may connect to the server host, one on port 9090 and one on port 9091.

It isn't nearly finished, with only map display and server code completed.

TODO:
Map generation
Return the map states to the players.(Not too sure about the best way to do this.)
Health for players
Attack for players
Some kind of API for clients
Sample AI for players
